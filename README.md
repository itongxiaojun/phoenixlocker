# PhoenixLocker Protocol

An Ethereum smart contract fund management protocol based on Bill Gates' principle that "Microsoft is always 18 months away from bankruptcy".

## Project Overview

PhoenixLocker Protocol is a smart contract system that allows users to deposit USDT and withdraw funds in installments over an 18-month cycle. This design philosophy is inspired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates' famous statement, emphasizing the need for enterprises to maintain 18 months of stable cash flow.

## Core Features

### 1. Deposit Function
- Users can transfer USDT to the smart contract
- Automatically calculates daily and monthly withdrawable amounts
- Records deposit time and transaction history

### 2. Installment Withdrawal
- **Daily Withdrawal**: Can withdraw 1/(18Ã—30) = 1/540 of total amount daily
- **Monthly Withdrawal**: Can withdraw 1/18 of total amount monthly
- Only depositors can withdraw their own funds

### 3. Query Functions
- Query user's total funds in the contract
- Query daily/monthly withdrawable amounts
- Query total funds in the entire contract
- Query all accounts with funds
- Query user's deposit and withdrawal records

### 4. Security Features
- Reentrancy attack protection
- Only depositors can withdraw their own funds
- Emergency withdrawal function (withdraw all remaining funds)

## Technical Architecture

- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.0
- **Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin Contracts
- **Development Framework**: Hardhat
- **Testing Framework**: Mocha + Chai

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Compile Contracts
```bash
npm run compile
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### 4. Start Local Network
```bash
npm run node
```

### 5. Deploy Contracts
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 6. Start Web Interface
```bash
cd frontend && python3 -m http.server 8001
```

## Contract Interface

### Main Functions

#### Deposit
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount) external
```

#### Daily Withdrawal
```solidity
function withdrawDaily() external
```

#### Monthly Withdrawal
```solidity
function withdrawMonthly() external
```

#### Emergency Withdrawal
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw() external
```

### Query Functions

#### Query User Balance
```solidity
function getUserBalance(address user) external view returns (
    uint256 totalAmount,
    uint256 remainingAmount,
    uint256 withdrawnAmount
)
```

#### Query Withdrawable Amounts
```solidity
function getUserWithdrawableAmounts(address user) external view returns (
    uint256 dailyWithdrawable,
    uint256 monthlyWithdrawable
)
```

#### Query Contract Total Balance
```solidity
function getTotalContractBalance() external view returns (uint256)
```

#### Query All Users
```solidity
function getAllDepositUsers() external view returns (address[] memory)
```

#### Query Transaction Records
```solidity
function getUserTransactions(address user) external view returns (Transaction[] memory)
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Deposit
```javascript
// First approve the contract to use USDT
await usdtContract.approve(phoenixLockerAddress, amount);

// Deposit
await phoenixLocker.deposit(amount);
```

### 2. Query Balance
```javascript
const [totalAmount, remainingAmount, withdrawnAmount] = 
    await phoenixLocker.getUserBalance(userAddress);
```

### 3. Withdraw Funds
```javascript
// Daily withdrawal
await phoenixLocker.withdrawDaily();

// Monthly withdrawal
await phoenixLocker.withdrawMonthly();
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy Attack Protection**: Uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
2. **Access Control**: Only depositors can withdraw their own funds
3. **Overflow Protection**: Uses Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow checks
4. **Time Lock**: Limits withdrawal frequency according to set time intervals

## Deployment Instructions

### Mainnet Deployment
1. Modify the USDT address in `scripts/deploy.js` to the mainnet address
2. Configure network settings in `hardhat.config.js`
3. Set private key and RPC node
4. Run deployment script

### Testnet Deployment
1. Use testnet USDT address or deploy MockUSDT
2. Obtain testnet ETH for gas fees
3. Run deployment script
